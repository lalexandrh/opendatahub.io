It brings the following features:\n<ul>\n<li>Ease of use with <code>Codeflare SDK</code>: The Codefare SDK is integrated into the out-of-the-box ODH notebook images and provides an interactive client for data scientists to define resource requirements (GPU, CPU, and memory) and to submit and manage training jobs.</li>\n<li>Batch Management with <code>Multi-Cluster Application Dispatcher (MCAD)</code>: MCAD manages a queue of training jobs that data scientists submit. MCAD ensures that jobs are not started until all required compute resources are available on the cluster. MCAD ensures that a given team has not requested more aggregate resources than their quota allows, and ensures that highest priority jobs are executed first. Finally, MCAD ensures that all processes necessary to execute a distributed run are scheduled concurrently, meaning that compute cycles aren’t wasted waiting for processes to be scheduled.</li>\n<li>Dynamic scaling with <code>InstaScale</code>: InstaScale works alongside MCAD to ensure that the OpenShift cluster contains sufficient compute resources to execute a job. InstaScale optimizes compute costs by launching the right-sizes compute instance for a given job, and releasing these instances when they are no longer needed.</li>\n<li><code>KubeRay</code> for management of remote Ray clusters on Kubernetes for running distributed compute workloads</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>There is a quickstart for the stack available at <a href=\"https://github.com/opendatahub-io/distributed-workloads/blob/main/Quick-Start.md\">https://github.com/opendatahub-io/distributed-workloads/blob/main/Quick-Start.md</a></li>\n<li>Refer to <a href=\"https://cloud.redhat.com/blog/ai/ml-models-batch-training-at-scale-with-open-data-hub\">https://cloud.redhat.com/blog/ai/ml-models-batch-training-at-scale-with-open-data-hub</a> for more information!</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"Incubation of Distributed Workloads stack in ODH","author":"anishasthana","categories":"features, release, documentation","preview":"ODH is now incubating a Distributed Workloads stack","date":"May 19, 2023"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"21636f5b-4595-5154-afcf-b8332d108a3c"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2604506565"],"slicesMap":{}}
